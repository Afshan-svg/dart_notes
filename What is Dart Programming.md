# What is Dart Programming?

**Dart** is a modern, open-source programming language developed by Google. It is designed for building **fast, scalable, and high-performance applications** for mobile, web, and desktop.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented:** Dart supports classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Strongly Typed:** Variables have types, but type inference with `var` is supported.
- **Compiled Language:** Dart can be compiled **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** for fast startup or **Just-in-Time (JIT)** for development and hot reload.
- **Cross-Platform:** Primarily used with **Flutter** for building apps on iOS, Android, web, and desktop.
- **Null Safety:** Dart prevents null errors by distinguishing nullable and non-nullable types.

## Advantages

- Fast performance due to AOT compilation.
- Easy to learn syntax, similar to Java, C#, and JavaScript.
- Excellent for UI development with Flutter.
- Supports asynchronous programming using `async`, `await`, and `Future`.

## Example: Basic Dart Program

```dart
void main() {
  String productName = 'Laptop';
  double price = 1200.50;

  print('Product: $productName');
  print('Price: \$${price}');
}
````

**Explanation:**

* `main()` is the entry point of a Dart program.
* Variables `productName` and `price` store product details.
* `print()` displays information in the console.

Dart is especially popular for e-commerce and mobile apps because of its fast UI rendering and seamless cross-platform capabilities.
